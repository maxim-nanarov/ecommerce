# Project: Ecommerce-1

Create a page in an e-commerce website that sells laptops. The page shows a list of laptops.

Here's an [example of such a page](https://www.pc365.co.il/cat-106-מחשבים_ניידים_וטאבלטים).

For each laptop on the page, you should show:
* A picture
* Title
* Specs
* Price
* Company logo
* Any additional fields you'd like to add

The top of the page should show a filter based on price range, screen size and company (and possibly more).

There should be sorting based on company and price - low-to-high and high-to-low.

Make the UI support at most 20 items (no need for pagination).

Some more requirements:
* Use scss and typescript. No backend is needed - this is only client-side.
* Use the gulp_typescript starter project.
* `npm start` should build the code and open the browser with the page.
* The data should be "hard coded" in typescript.
* Separate your code into a "data layer" that doesn't depend on HTML and the browser, and the UI, which does.
  The data layer should hold all the data, and provide sorting and filtering.
* Use Flexbox. You can read about it in the Wakka course.

Code quality matters:
* Run the linter often
* Separate your code into meaningful files
* Avoid spelling mistakes
* Choose good names for things
* Avoid code duplication
* Document as needed - not too much and not too little


May you commit and push often!
